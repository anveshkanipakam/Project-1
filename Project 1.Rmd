The trees dataset contains three variables for Black Cherry Trees:
- **Girth**: Girth of the tree trunk (in inches)
- **Height**: Height of the tree (in feet)
- **Volume**: Volume of the tree (in cubic feet)

This analysis explores the relationship between **Girth and Volume**, addressing the question:

**"How does tree girth correlate with tree volume?"**

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
